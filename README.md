# Project - Sustainable Spaces - We are [Live](https://sustainable-spaces.vercel.app/) (Please view on a phone as the desktop/tablet view has not been completed yet)

The goal of this app is as follows:

- to allow users, renters and homeowners a way to effortless buy (both renters and homeowners), rent (renters), sell (homeowners) homes. The app offers renters a way to earn free rent in exchange for helping the effort to crowdfund the purchase of homes via a lottery.
- to provide rent stabilization through crowdfunding. We hope to be able to reduce the cost of owning a house, thus having less expenses that would require a higher rent to achieve some sort of cash flow.
- to provide homeowners with the tools to efficiently check a renters background, collect payment, schedule cleanings and other services like handyman work.

### The "Free Housing Sweepstakes" Mechanic -- Deemed illegal in Florida under Gambling laws -- unless under a charitable organization according to the [law](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0800-0899/0849/Sections/0849.0935.html)

Until we can get around the legality of `Gambling` in the state of Florida. This feature will be unavailable and under construction.

After achieving a set amount ($75,000), users who have contributed towards the crowdfund (minimum of $100) will have a chance to obtain free rent (4) months worth (minimum) up to 12 months (maximum). Each minimum contribution of $100 will be 1 drawing up to 40 entries ($4000 value). For every 4 entries (rounded down) contributed after attaining 8, if selected for free rent, you will recieve an additional month of free rent. Free rent is split up over a year, for example:

- if you recieve the minimum 4 months free rent, you will recieve free rent every 3rd month up to a year.
- if you contributed $1600, and are selected for free rent, you have 6 months of free rent and will receive free rent every 2nd month.
- if you contributed $2400, you have 8 months, you would recieve free rent after 1 month followed by 2 months of free rent
- and so forth...

You'll be notified of a move-in date if you reside in the state/city the home was purchased in or recieve a stipend of $1000 - $1200/month.

### Rent Caps

In the event we acqiure homes through crowdfunding, we will make rent equal to PITI (principal, interest, taxes, insurance) \* ~1.28 (capex, management, vacancy, other fees\* AKA Essential Fees, **Disclaimer:** subject to change due to payment processors and etc that we have no control over) + 15%. For example:
PITI | Essential Fees | Flat Rate | Total
|----|----|----|----|
Base | 1.28% | 15% | varies
1000 | 280 | 192 | 1472

| PITI | Essential Fees     | Capex | Management | Vacancy | Other Fees | Total  |
| ---- | ------------------ | ----- | ---------- | ------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Base | Base \* 1.28       | 10%   | 5%         | 5%      | varies     | varies |
| 1000 | Fees based on 1280 | 128   | 64         | 64      | 28         | 1472   |

Cost Breakdown:

- PITI: $1,000
- PITI + Capex, Management, Vacancy: $1,000 \* 1.28 = $1,280
  - Capex: 10% = $128
  - Management: 5% = $64
  - Vacancy: 5% = $64
  - Other Fee: $1,280 - $1,000 - $128 - $64 - $64 = $24
- Flat Rate: 15% = $1,280 \* 0.15 = $192

Total Monthly Rent: $1,472

### Rent Increases:

Rent will increase yearly due to inflation (minimum 5%), capped to the CPI or 5%, whichever is higher. For example:

- PITI: $1,050 (5% increase)
- PITI + Capex, Management, Vacancy: $1,050 \* 1.28 = $1,344
  - Capex: 10% = $134
  - Management: 5% = $67
  - Vacancy: 5% = $67
  - Other Fee: $1,344 - $1,050 - $134 - $67 - $67 = $26
- Flat Rate: 15% = $1,344 \* 0.15 = $201.6

Total Monthly Rent After Increase: $1,545.6

  - **Issues:**
    - CORS when sending a request from the client.
  - **Fixes:**
